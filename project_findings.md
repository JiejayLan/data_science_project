### Project Findings for Questions and Tasks section

## Data Usage.

Our team researched about various topics for factors that affect the rental price beside the ones that 
provided in the dataset. The first factor that came to our mind was the average income by zipcode, because 
it directly represents peoples' economic strength in that area, so it is reasonable to assume that the 
area that has a higher average income tend to have a higher rental price, and the correlation between average income based on the zipcode and rent is 0.393228, which is significant.

The other factor is the unemployment rate, people tend to stay in the areas that have more working opportunities, therefore we can assume that the areas with high unemployment rate are more likely to have lower rent. We found that the correlation between zip_ unemployment _rate and rent is -0.167267 which clearly shows that the unemployment rate and rent has a negative correlation, which indicates that area with higher unemployment rate tend to have a lower rent, but the relationship is not that significant comparing to the average income.

We also added several other dataset including the Population dataset from NYC OpenData, housing sale price dataset from kaggle and median estimated rental values dataset from Zillow since population of the neighborhood, housing prices and median rental price of the zipcode could possibly affect our the estimated rental. 

## Data Exploration.

As we have stated in the initial finding, there are some outliers that are not reasonable in real world scene such as rent,bathrooms,size_ sqft,year_ built,min_ to_subway and floor number, so we set up several boundaries to each element to eliminate these outliers. 

Missing values can be a challenge for our analysis, because if we just simply drop all of them, our MSE will be affect significantly. Therefore, we replaced missing data on floor number with the mode value of all floor numbers, replaced missing min_to_subway with the mean value, and year_built with their mean as well. 

Some features like the addr_unit, building_id and so on can be problematic since they are not directly relate to the rent that we are predicting, so we encoded categorical features and drop useless features to make the modeling process clean. 

We have plotted the scatter plots for the continuous_features in the data cleaning section.

## Transformation and Modeling.

As we have stated in the initial findings,according to the result of OLS Regression table and feature_importances from sci-kit learn, we can see that features such as size_sqft, bathrooms, bedroom, and zip_ average_ income (which is obtained from our external dataset) are driving the modeling performance because generally people cares about the size and bathrooms/bedroom of the house and zip average income represent average people's affordability, and for binary features, weâ€™ve checked the correlation for them, as the correlation table indicated, all binary features could highly affected the rents, thus we included all binary features when building our models.

One important feature or modification that we had is to append test1 set to train set when we loaded the datasets, since this allow us to have a larger set which we can split it and conduct cross validation when evaluating models. The other important feature is the turning of the hyperparameters for tree based models. By using functions that help us find the better parameters, we did achieve better results.

For the implementation of our models, we followed the same format as provided in the lecture, where we used cross validation to evaluate each model and then compare the performances of different models in terms of mean squared error in order to build the most suitable model for our data. For the choice of our models, we picked Multiple Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and Random Forest Regression. 

For each model we set up parameters according to the nature of the model and apply tuning hyper parameters if possible, so that we will get reasonably good result from each model. In order to obtain the optimal result, we tried to apply some basic deep learning into our model training procedure, thus we also build a Neural Network Regression which gave outstanding result. However, due to the fact that Neural Network Regression is not stable, we chose the Gradient Boosting Regression instead. We think this type of model works well because it builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.Therefore, in our case, it is more stable and minimize the errors that we made comparing to other models that we used.

## Metrics, Validation, and Evaluation.

We have chosen Gradient Boosting Regression as our final model, we think that this model performs fairly well on the test set, since as we have recorded on our first report, we tested five model: Multiple Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Neural Network Regression. After compared their resulted mean squared error through cross validation and predicted against test1 set, we found out that Gradient Boosting Regression gave us the best result with mean squared error of 927079.4423014012 (different from the first submission since we have added in several external data). We believe that this is a decent result of mean squared error. We also plot a accuracy report to visualize the goodness of the fit of the predictions ( The visualization is in our Jupyter notebook under the Gradient Boosting Regression modeling section, and this will be our answer to part d), and it shows that most of the predictions fit on the line beside some extreme cases, this implies that the performance of this model is fairly well.

Since the mean squared error implies the average amount of error in our predicted values compare to the actual values, and for our model, the mean square error is decent, thus we believe that our model is useful, as the resulted mean squared error, and the performance showed on accuracy report both indicate that the predictions created by this model is fairly accurate, and can be meaningful representations to solve our problem which is to predict the rent value.

Our model works the best on the address unit #7C on 240 EAST 27 STREET, NEW YORK, 10016 [link](https://streeteasy.com/property/7815532-parc-east-7c), the actual rent is 5565 and our predicted rent is 5565.232661 with error percentage of 0.000042 which is really close. In the other hand the worst performance happens on unit 1204 of 120 WEST 21 STREET, NEW YORK, 10011 [link](https://streeteasy.com/property/1321506-21-chelsea-1204), the actual rent is 6897, but our predicted rent is 13933.520479 with error percentage of 1.020229.

For visualization that demonstrates the predictive power of our model, it is an accuracy graph that shows the goodness of the fit of the predictions by a line, it is under the Gradient Boosting Regression modeling section in our Jupyter notebook: [Link](https://github.com/JiejayLan/data_science_project/blob/master/main.ipynb)

## Conclusion.

For our accurate rent predition model, we can use it in multiple way. First, for online real estate platform, they can use to detect any fake price posting, either too high or too low. For exmaple, if a leaser post a incredible low price, the platform can detect at the time he posts instead of identify it manually. Secondly, as a customer, we can use this as a tool for reference price, which can prevent from price inflaction or price cheating. Third, right now we only use New York area dataset to train our model, in the future if we use other area' s rent price dataset to train the model, we can also provide rent predition for other cities. 

If we can add more additional model features.
- Some features related to bin and bbl, like tax and personal income based on bin and bbl
- Historical price for the apartment
- Average price change in the area compared to last year
- Decoration design

We would perfer to have more data at this point, because we have have 10000 entities for the traning set, which is far from enough. If we have more data, we can increase the accuracy of our model. Of course features are very imforportant, but we have to mare sure we have enough data first.
