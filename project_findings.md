## Data Usage

Our team researched about various topics for factors that affect the rental price beside the ones that 
provided in the dataset. The first factor that came to our mind was the average income by zipcode, because 
it directly represents peoples' Economic strength in that area, so it it reasonable to assume that the 
area has a higher average income tend to have a higher rental price....

The other factor is the unemployement rate, people tend to stay in the areas that have more working opportunities, therefore logicially thinking, the areas with high underemployemnt rate are more likely to have lower rent.
