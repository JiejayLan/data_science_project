Centrally located, it allows for easy exploration. Take in a show on Broadway or soak up the sun in Central Park. From Hells Kitchen, JFK Airport is about half an hour away without traffic.

A huge planted terrace. And a fully furnished roofdeck with 360 views of the entire the Manhattan skyline plus Brooklyn, Queens, and what lies beyond.

Units further come replete with stainless steel appliances, built in dishwashers that match the cabinetwork, and the option to add a washer/dryer in unit.

The building itself is a local landmark and you see that history on a quick tour. From its largely preserved exterior, to the marque sign out front that serves as an iconic balcony, the development was built with care to preserve the feel, history, and excitement of the site; giving tenants an unparalleled living experience.

The 6 floor structure was built in 1910 and gutted just a few years ago, keeping many of it's original details, exposed piping, brick, and woodwork. 26 lofts have been carved out of the interior which includes elevators, laundry room, bicycle storage, gym facility, courtyard, and rooftop deck with 360 degree views. The property is surrounded by trees on a quite intersection, steps away from Graham Ave, Metropolitan Ave, and some of the area's top restaurants & bars (we really love the Mexican Eats at Mesa Coyocan, fish at Sel de Mar, and cocktails at The Richardson).

OUR OPINION: The lofts are timeless. We love the wide plank Raw Oak Flooring that has been installed throughout all the units and hallways and the exposed beveled concrete ceiling with piping is very cool. This particular unit houses roughly 725sqft of living-space. The ceiling is about 12ft high. The glass french door division can be removed. We believe this is a great apartment. we would knock down the wall and turn it into one large open Loft.

Introducing one of the largest and most sought-after co-op buildings in all of Greenwich Village, 250 Mercer Street. Having recently undergone a major renovation, the building now features brand new elevators, carpeted hallways with designer lighting, and will have a completely renovated lobby by mid-summer 2017. This historic multi-building complex of four towers (A-D) was formerly a cast iron factory and was originally built in 1890. The building was converted from commercial to residential in 1979 when it debuted with 275 rental apartments, and later became a co-op in 1986. The building’s industrial origins and unique original detail afford residents the advantages of loft-like layouts, 12- to 16-foot ceilings and classic city views. What separates this co-op from the rest is also the flexible, condo-style sublet policy. This extremely liberal co-op also allows pets, pieds-a-terre, co-purchasing, and guarantors. Amenities at this prewar co-op include a full-time doorman, live-in super, furnished courtyard and roof deck, bicycle storage, and laundry facilities. Ideally located in the center of trendy NoHo between West 3rd and 4th streets, 250 Mercer is a short distance to Washington Square Park and only blocks from some of the city’s best shopping and restaurants in SoHo, Nolita, and West Village.

 It's only a 20 minute commute to Columbus Circle. Now the closets train being 155, it takes me 20-30 minutes depending and I've lived in the building next door for 4 years. This location is ideal for Uptown! It's literally on Highbridge Park and across the street is the Jumel Mansion which keeps it's beautiful landscaped gardens open to the public. Perfect for reading a book, throwing a Frisbee, a picnic, or any other relaxing thing you can think to do. It is very private and rarely draws a crowd. NOTE: There are so many great things about this area including a New Super Food Town that just opened on West 160th and Broadway just 4 blocks away (2 blocks and 1 Avenue). But too many good things to keep your attention. I'll be happy to discuss others at a viewing.

Sunlight and open cityscapes abound throughout this home with three exposures (S, W, N) along with a total of three separate outdoor spaces -- two terraces and a balcony. Sunlight and open cityscapes abound throughout this home with three exposures (S, W, N) along with a total of three separate outdoor spaces -- two terraces and a balcony. With two large living areas and a palatial entry gallery, this 2 bedroom and 2 bath space has all the room you could desire for effortless living and entertaining. PHD has approximately 2,143 SF interior and 660 SF exterior. No hyperbole here -- you really must see this one to fall in love! Entering through the private-keyed elevator on the upper level, the breadth of the apartment greets you with its inviting expansive gallery including 16-foot super-high ceilings, nuanced with interesting artwork and notable OLampia lighting. This level is the primary living space with a windowed open kitchen, including Miele appliances, with a W/D unit tucked away in a contained step-in closet. As well, with this integrated Kitchen, the appliances are hidden by surfaces matching the cabinetry. The rectangular dining area flows from here along a wall with multiple windows into the L-shaped main living area, which includes a centerpiece black marble fireplace. Following up a half-level is the spectacular, bright and large 2nd living area library with its beautiful walnut floors (also throughout the entire apartment) that culminates onto the largest of the terraces. Equipped with outdoor furniture, this terrace maintains a beautiful serenity both day and night. Down the lit-steps stairway from the main level entrance gallery, the lower level could also be called the sleeping level. With the second separate keyed entry from the building hallway, this level contains both the owner's bedroom and the second bedroom, each with its own en-suite bathroom, as well as its own glass-door access to the second terrace. The owner's bedroom also has two walk-in closets and a built-in bed with nightstands and reading lights. The second bedroom also has two closets, consisting of the full length of one wall. Of note, the main owner's bedroom walk-in closet is built within an exterior building turret topped with a huge round skylight that creates a quite zen atmosphere. It also has fully built-in hardwood hanger spaces, shelves and mirrors. A fully-wired integrated audio/security system is smart-phone controlled. The Pythian is a legendary UWS building originally built in 1926 as a temple for the Knights of Pythias and subsequently converted into a condominium in 1983. Architecturally, it is highly regarded as a blockbuster synthesis of Egyptian, Babylonian and Assyrian motifs evoking the grandeur of D. W. Griffith's Babylonian movie set for his 1916 film 'Intolerance'. The Pythian Temple's ground-floor colonnade, with Assyrian-type heads, is centered on a brilliantly glazed blue terra-cotta entry pavilion. The middle section steps back at about 100 feet up, with four seated Pharaonic figures, similar to those of Ramses II at Abu Simbel. Two more setbacks rise to a highly colored Egyptian-style colonnade, and to giant urns carried by teams of yellow, red and green oxen. Spectacular! Pets Allowed.

The onsite laundry is a great plus. The apartment is nice and sunny.

You might never need it with NYC's many order-in options, but the kitchen was gut renovated and has a kitchenette layout, new countertops, a window, and tile floors. The unit comes with stainless steel appliances, plenty of storage, a gas oven, a full-sized refrigerator, and a gas range.

The bedroom has good storage, a window with a view, and hardwood floors. It's a large bedroom. You should have space for a king.

Inside the gut renovated bathroom you'll find a standard tub, a standard shower, good storage, and granite finishes. There's also a window in the bathroom.

It's rare in NYC, at this price range, to find a building that's rarely available, well maintained, loved by tenants, and leasing up fast. This building is exactly that. Here's a snapshot of the amenities in the building: a part-time doorman, Verizon FiOS internet, clean and lighted hallways, a front door buzzer, parking on street, a live-in super, and security cameras.

This is a floor-thru apartment, meaning it extends from the front of the brownstone to the back. Here's the layout: a beautiful 185 sq. ft kitchen/living area, a LARGE 282 square ft. BEDROOM in the front, and a smaller 121 square ft. second BEDROOM in the back. The bathroom, which is a whopping 146 sq. ft., is in the middle. Tenants can use the space as they like, though. The current tenants-- a couple -- use the small back bedroom as their bedroom and used the large front bedroom as their living room.

The owner has preserved the original wood details, from the wood fireplace mantel and pocket shutters in the bedroom to the beautiful old wood cabinets and wood floors in the kitchen, and the old oak cupboards in the bathroom. It feels like you're walking into a home in the French countryside. Yet modern amenities were not spared. The unit has new stainless steel appliances, including the chef's range, and a DISHWASHER.

Clinton is trendy among those looking for a diverse place that still captures the history of New York. Now a haven for young professionals, actors, and writers, particularly ones who work in the Theater district, and is known for a high concentration of excellent and diverse restaurants, as well as some of the best bars and night spots in Manhattan. Clinton witnessed a construction boom over the past decade and because of that, there are many high-end luxury buildings and businesses that cater to those with exquisite taste. Separated from the Theater District by quiet, tree-lined streets, on street parking and much to do for locals, the HeII's Kitchen/Clinton area is unique. Where neighbors wave to neighbors and friendly local acquaintances nod and say hello, you'll feel very much at home here. Virtually every subway line in the city runs through the station at Times Square. Clinton residents are truly an eclectic mix of middle income and upper-class New Yorkers.",Midtown West,Manhattan,3B,3.0,B

With todays social and technological paradigms in mind, 10 Montieth invites residents into a ground-breaking world of accessibility and connectivity, one that celebrates user experience and champions shared perspective. Encapsulating one full block in Brooklyns coveted Bushwick neighborhood, 10 Montieths distinct modular form holds studio, one, and two-bedroom apartments at affordable and market rates, each pixelating the buildings faade with cascading terraces. Here, living space extends beyond each apartments four walls with ample outdoor space: the sloping rooftop garden is primed for group activities or moments of solitude while the inner courtyards serve as unexpected urban retreats.

Where most residential buildings play it safe, 10 Montieth breaks the mold. The O-shaped height is lowered in key areas to increase sunlight exposure for the courtyard and interior facades while tethering the building to the community with a scaled down vertical footprint. Similarly, the sloped roof creates unique points of access from the top levels of the building and the structures shape allows for views of Manhattan from street-facing and inner courtyard apartments. A living, breathing canvas of expression for its residents and community, 10 Montieth is the ideal address for New Yorks next wave of visionaries.",Bushwick,Brooklyn,171,2.0,171
