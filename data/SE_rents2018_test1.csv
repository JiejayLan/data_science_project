Grab your bike from the bike room and head over to Devocion coffee shop for some of the best coffee in the world. While theres plenty to do around the Azure, you also have the opportunity to converse with your neighbors on the outdoor terrace or in the 3rd-floor tenants lounge, where you can find a wet bar, game room, and business center.

With todays social and technological paradigms in mind, 10 Montieth invites residents into a ground-breaking world of accessibility and connectivity, one that celebrates user experience and champions shared perspective. Encapsulating one full block in Brooklyns coveted Bushwick neighborhood, 10 Montieths distinct modular form holds studio, one, and two-bedroom apartments at affordable and market rates, each pixelating the buildings faade with cascading terraces. Here, living space extends beyond each apartments four walls with ample outdoor space: the sloping rooftop garden is primed for group activities or moments of solitude while the inner courtyards serve as unexpected urban retreats.

Where most residential buildings play it safe, 10 Montieth breaks the mold. The O-shaped height is lowered in key areas to increase sunlight exposure for the courtyard and interior facades while tethering the building to the community with a scaled down vertical footprint. Similarly, the sloped roof creates unique points of access from the top levels of the building and the structures shape allows for views of Manhattan from street-facing and inner courtyard apartments. A living, breathing canvas of expression for its residents and community, 10 Montieth is the ideal address for New Yorks next wave of visionaries.

Fully-Renovated Townhouse with 5 Bedrooms, 3 Full-Baths and 2 Half-Baths

Steps from main thoroughfares, transportation, and Harlem hotspots, sits this landmark single-family townhouse. Built in the late 1880s by distinguished architect Francis Kimball, and then totally renovated and restored by David Mann, 133 West 122nd Street is exceptionally chic and fits any lifestyle.

Boasting seven decorative fireplaces, gorgeous parquet floors, impeccable millwork and moldings, and treasures such as stained glass transoms and pocket doors with inlaid windows, the townhouse contains everything one desires in a historic home. Additionally, all five stories celebrate modern clean lines by incorporating customized shelving, sleek tiles and countertops, and vertical accents that highlight soaring ceilings. With four bedrooms, three full and two half-baths, formal entertaining spaces, a state-of-the-art kitchen, and private garden, this rental opportunity should not be missed.

Garden Floor:
An entrance under the stoop leads to an enclosed hallway that serves as a mudroom with organized hooks and benches for transitioning out of the hustle and bustle of the city. The garden level is primed for entertaining. A formal dining room is situated at the front of the floor. It features a corner fireplace, original wainscoting, and an impressive built-in sideboard.

The garden rear contains a modern, country-style kitchen with 17-foot granite island, farmhouse-style sink, and top-of-the-line appliances including a six burner JennAir gas stove, two SubZero refrigerators, and Miele dishwasher. There is also a large pantry, open hearth, and bay window. A powder room completes the floor.

The townhouse garden is accessed from the kitchen. It is a quiet oasis with professional landscaping, high privacy fence, and mature trees.

Parlour Floor:
This parlour floor is beyond compare. From the ornate built-in hall tree complete with mirror and bench in the foyer, to the arch-framed bay window in the living room and central gallery with grand staircase, you will be ""wowed? at every turn.

The parlour front is occupied by a sitting room that can be used for formal or private occasions by shutting the pocket doors. In addition to the lovely bay window that overlooks the garden, the spacious rear living room has a wall full of bookshelves and a library ladder. The living room is also separated from the gallery by pocket doors. Both rooms have beautiful fireplaces with ornate mantelpieces and patterned tiles surrounding the hearths.

Third Floor:
No modern home is complete without a master bedroom suite, and this townhouse doesn't disappoint. The third floor rear is occupied by a grand bedroom with an arched entryway, exquisite moldings, fireplace, and two large windows that overlook the garden. The bedroom also features a wall of custom floor-to-ceiling closets that is streamlined and wonderfully integrated with historical architectural elements.

Pocket doors provide access to the centralized bathroom from both the front and rear rooms of the master suite. Highlights include two pedestal sinks, a glass-enclosed shower, separate WC, and sparkling white button tiles.

The third floor front is a dedicated home office. It is an energetic and creative space boasting three windows with stained glass transoms, original fireplace, and multiple shelving configurations. The room could easily be used as a bedroom if needed.

Fourth Floor:
The fourth floor hosts two sunny bedroom suites. Both front and rear bedrooms have fireplaces with original wood mantels and marble or brick hearths as well as ample closet space. Each private suite boasts a spacious full bathroom with classic claw-foot bathtubs and pedestal sinks.

Fifth Floor:
Climb up the rear staircase to discover a private family retreat. The fifth floor of the townhouse features a study nook and a comfortable, informal living room, which could also be a fifth bedroom. Each area has a window to take in views of the city skyline, and there is a skylight over the living room for extra sunshine or stargazing. The floor also contains a powder room as well as access points to attic storage and the roof.

Cellar:
The cellar contains a bright and tidy laundry room with sink and countertop workspaces. Separate mechanical and storage areas are also present on this floor.",Central Harlem,Manhattan,,,

The kitchens are the envy of designers and chefs alike with high-style and high-performance elements that include white matte custom cabinetry and gleaming stainless steel appliances. The Caesarstone countertops at these Brooklyn apartment rentals are spacious enough for all your gourmet pursuits and glamorous enough to play bar for a night during parties.

The residential architecture in Morningside Heights is elegant and imposing; the distinct history of Morningside Heights makes it like no place else in New York. Morningside Heights has many charming restaurants and stores, not to mention a lively nightlife, so it is not simply a place for those who are in search of a quiet, historically hallowed area (although it certainly is that too).

Just a block away from dynamic Washington Square this gorgeous and cozy studio apartment is ground floor and street-facing. It is located in a safe and beautiful neighborhood right next to 5th avenue. The crowd in this prime central / west village neighborhood is well-rounded and active around the clock; it consists of young professionals, artists, writers, celebrities, entrepreneurs, and more. 

This location is one of the most coveted in the village area; it contains many historic co-ops and townhouses and is one of the safest locations. This street is quiet as compared to Sixth avenue and has an active and effective block association which has restored much of the aesthetic of the neighborhood (victorian-style street lamps, tree basins, seasonal plantings) and eliminated noise, crime and development in the neighborhood. 
 
Due to these restorations and the beautiful architecture, many call this neighborhood the Gold Coast. The individual historic-designated townhouses, meticulously maintained seasonal plantings and trees, and victorian style surroundings make the Gold Coast the most quaint and enchanting neighborhood in Greenwich Village. 
 
Although Washington Square park is regarded as the heart of the neighborhood there are also many other, smaller parks contributing to the aesthetic: Father Fagan, Minetta Triangle, Petrosino Square, Little Red Square, and Time Landscape. For kids there are also many nearby playgrounds including : Desalvio, Minetta, Thompson Street, Bleecker Street, Downing Street, Mercer Street, Cpl. John A. Seravelli, and William Passannante Ballfield.

Encapsulating one full block in Brooklyns coveted Bushwick neighborhood, 10 Montieths distinct modular form holds studio, one, and two-bedroom apartments at affordable and market rates, each pixelating the buildings faade with cascading terraces. Here, living space extends beyond each apartments four walls with ample outdoor space: the sloping rooftop garden is primed for group activities or moments of solitude while the inner courtyards serve as unexpected urban retreats.

Where most residential buildings play it safe, 10 Montieth breaks the mold. The O-shaped height is lowered in key areas to increase sunlight exposure for the courtyard and interior facades while tethering the building to the community with a scaled down vertical footprint. Similarly, the sloped roof creates unique points of access from the top levels of the building and the structures shape allows for views of Manhattan from street-facing and inner courtyard apartments. A living, breathing canvas of expression for its residents and community, 10 Montieth is the ideal address for New Yorks next wave of visionaries.

This 6-story building dates from the early 1920's, and you can count on the on-call super and nearby manager, both very responsive. You will also have laundry in the basement at your disposal (card-operated machines).

Located on one of the most desirable streets of historic Brooklyn Heights, 145 Henry is as convenient as can be in terms of transit options, with quick access to a long list of major subway lines, including the express 2/3, 4/5 and A/C trains, as well as the local R train. The neighborhood also offers many shops and restaurants to choose from, including five supermarkets (Trader Joe's is minutes away), a 24h deli on the block, and a pharmacy across the street.

And with the Promenade a few steps from your door, you will have prime access to those sweeping Manhattan skyline views. 

Pets are more than welcome!

Tired of seeing rentals that simply just don't live up to the hype? Places that you can't see yourself in, but the market is so watered down that you accept less than you deserve. Here is a fully renovated two bedroom, one bath, rental on the main floor of a semi-detached house. 

The apartment is spacious, bright, with three exposures, with lots of space to stretch out and relax. Each room as at least one window. Premium materials were used when the unit was renovated. New custom doors, premium door handles, upgraded led lighting, quartz countertops, original hardwood flooring, stainless steel appliances, and an amazing closet system in the master bedroom. Apartment is pre-wired for cable, internet, and has a video intercom system. I'm boasting, but you have to see the apartment in person to truly appreciate the flow and the level of thought the owner has put in to make a tenant feel at home.

This is a NO FEE apartment! Tenant pays first month rent and $2250 refundable security deposit. Must make 40x rent roll, have verifiable rental history, and respectable credit score. Heat and hot water included in monthly rent, and tenant responsible for their electric, gas charges, and cable bill. Sorry, no pets.

With todays social and technological paradigms in mind, 10 Montieth invites residents into a ground-breaking world of accessibility and connectivity, one that celebrates user experience and champions shared perspective. Encapsulating one full block in Brooklyns coveted Bushwick neighborhood, 10 Montieths distinct modular form holds studio, one, and two-bedroom apartments at affordable and market rates, each pixelating the buildings faade with cascading terraces. Here, living space extends beyond each apartments four walls with ample outdoor space: the sloping rooftop garden is primed for group activities or moments of solitude while the inner courtyards serve as unexpected urban retreats.

Where most residential buildings play it safe, 10 Montieth breaks the mold. The O-shaped height is lowered in key areas to increase sunlight exposure for the courtyard and interior facades while tethering the building to the community with a scaled down vertical footprint. Similarly, the sloped roof creates unique points of access from the top levels of the building and the structures shape allows for views of Manhattan from street-facing and inner courtyard apartments. A living, breathing canvas of expression for its residents and community, 10 Montieth is the ideal address for New Yorks next wave of visionaries.",Bushwick,Brooklyn,243,2.0,43

The Clare, located at the nexus of Midtown and the Upper East Side, provides both elegant shelter from the city and glorious views of the hustle and bustle outside. That duality is the foundation of The Clare’s universal appeal. 

This Studio apartment features walls of floor-to-ceiling windows, heated 7-inch wide white oak flooring, multi-zone heating and cooling systems, LED lighting throughout, and a washer and dryer. The finishes and color palette blend seamlessly with each other and the wide swath of visible sky.

A sleek open kitchen comes equipped with a full range of Miele appliances, framed by custom Poggenpohl cabinetry and quartz-topped counters. A floating island provides the kitchen’s perfect, and practical, centerpiece. 

The bathroom is outfitted with a Carrara Blanco-style marble floor and marble wall tiles by Porcelanosa. A Kohler soaking tub and open shower – with a modesty partition in frosted glass – are serene counterpoints to the extra-large gray quartz countertop with double sink, custom white matte lacquered vanities, generous medicine cabinet, and Watermark features.

The apartment also comes with dishwasher, garbage disposal, and a clothes washer and vent-less dryer.

The Clare's full floor of amenities, perched 13 stories high with 12-foot floor-to-ceiling windows, includes a fitness center and wellness studio; a spacious lounge with a dining room, living room, entertainment center, and pantry, outfitted in walnut and stainless steel; and an 800-square-foot landscaped terrace. 

The views are beyond magnificent, with city views towards Central Park, the Roosevelt Island Tram, the 59th Street Bridge, and Downtown.

The Clare has been brought to life by Manuel Glas Architects, known for their intelligent use of space and innovative, modern compositions. New Yorkers passing by cannot help but be moved by the magnificent light that reflects off a façade of panels by Porcelanosa, natural Indian limestone, and glass.

This former Tribeca textile merchant's building boasts a perfect meld of clean lines and rich detail. A beautifully restored Italianate cast-iron facade; the warm textures of exposed brick; and a striking tin ceiling recall a vivid past. The deep hue of wide-plank solid-oak floors, in combination with bright white walls, recessed lighting, and a sleek, custom-designed kitchen, define the dynamic, contemporary feel of the living space, which is open and expansive- in the very best tradition of the classic Tribeca loft. The kitchen is state-of-the-art, with an oversized chef's sink by Blanco, Sub-Zero fridge, Bosch convection oven and gas cooktop with a Gaggenau hood, and wine storage by GE Monogram. Dark stained oak cabinetry and white custom-cut corian countertops carry through the tones of the living area. The bathrooms offer up a pristine geometry, with a poured concrete vanity counter, and a Steamist steam shower, Zuma tub, Toto toilet, and slate gray stone floors and glass tile. The master bedroom features a walk-through closet that opens onto the master bath. The residences are filled with light. They boast high ceilings and tall windows. A cyber doorman and keyed elevator access provide ample privacy.

On the 23rd floor of a unique octagonal tower, this apartment is right on Central Park and within walking distance to Museum Mile, the core of Harlem, the Upper West Side, and a very quick subway ride to Times Square and Midtown. There's a lot that makes this apartment a rare NYC delight. First, the light-often a rare amenity in the city-is plentiful. The walls of windows in the living area face southeast and south in the bedrooms. The bedrooms receive unobstructed light throughout the day and enjoy partial views of the sun setting over Central Park.

The apartment has a beautiful sunrise-facing, glass-walled balcony with views to the South and Southeast, a dishwasher, multiple closets, laundry in building, elevator, and doorman. Great views of Central Park, East River and the Empire State Building. One bedroom is slightly larger, the smaller has the better park view, and both have closets. 

The 110th-Central Park North station with the 2 / 3 express trains and 110th St station with the local 6 train are convenient walks. Multiple grocery stores, bars, and restaurants are nearby. And, of course, Central Park and the Harlem Meer is right at your doorstep, which never gets old. Morning runs, picnics, and a plethora of free events are a few of the many benefits to door-front park access.

The living, dining, and kitchen areas span the corner, surrounded by windows overlooking the Hudson River and the leafy green esplanade below.  The space has been completely reconfigured, and the kitchen wall removed to create a dramatic,  loft-like feeling in this space which is unlike any other in South Battery Park City. Gleaming white countertops, cupboards, white subway tile backsplash, and stainless appliances make preparing meals a pleasure.  Open the window right next to the sink and bring in the fresh water breeze, or hear the leaves outside while you cook. 
Both bedrooms in 6D are large, and have River views. The master faces west, over the treetops and out to the water, and the 2nd bedroom looks out over  “the upper room” sculpture on the esplanade, and upriver.  The master has a marble en-suite bath, and a walk in closet.  There is an elegant, updated 2nd bathroom in the hall.
