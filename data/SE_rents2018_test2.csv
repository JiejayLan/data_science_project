Home to iconic actress Katharine Hepburn throughout her long career (1931-1990s), this renovated single-family brownstone epitomizes New York elegance. Now you can join Katharine Hepburn, Bob Dylan, Stephen Sondheim, and E.B. White on the long list of New York artists and icons who have resided in the celebrity enclave surrounding Turtle Bay Gardens, a picturesque private park.

The interiors of this townhouse have been updated to meet contemporary standards of luxury while preserving their historic character. The kitchen and bathrooms have been renovated with custom stone tiling, top-of-the-line appliances, and stylish fixtures. Meanwhile, historic details remain, including graceful floor-to-ceiling windows, woodburning fireplaces, and ornate mantelpieces. Katharine Hepburn's original built-in mirrored vanity is a classic Hollywood touch.

Fall in love with this home's Italianate garden, complete with a Renaissance-style fountain. Then step out into Turtle Bay Gardens, a lush oasis that few New Yorkers are ever privileged to explore.

Garden Level:
The main entrance leads you into the stone-tiled foyer. On your left is a newly-renovated eat-in kitchen. With a stainless steel Sub-Zero refrigerator as well as a six-burner Viking range and double oven, this is truly a chef 's kitchen. The dining area includes a built-in breakfast table with benches. Passing through the butler's pantry with china cabinets and wine refrigerator, you reach the rear dining room. A wood-burning fireplace, wall sconces, and hardwood floors make this room warm and inviting. A wide set of windows give light while a glass door opens to the garden.

This garden is one of the most peaceful in New York. Dine on the multi-level flagstone patio among flowering shrubs and berry-laden bushes. Nearby, water burbles from the mouth of a carved stone fish embraced by a cheerful putto. After dinner, stroll in Turtle Bay Gardens, a private pocket park accessible only to residents of the surrounding townhouses. Rest momentarily on one of the garden's hidden benches before discovering one of several babbling Italiante fountains amid the abundant greenery.

Parlour Level:
Up the stairs you reach the parlour level, with extremely high ceilings and elegant details. The rear living room has floor-to-ceiling windows with period shutters, as well as a woodburning fireplace and carved wood mantelpiece. Pass through the butler's pantry, or through the hallway and down three graceful steps to the front parlour. This romantic room has a wood-burning fireplace and marble mantel, hardwood floors, and three floor-to-ceiling French doors leading to a Juliet balcony.

Third Floor:
This master suite is refined and spacious. The rear bedroom contains a wood-burning fireplace, hardwood floors and high ceilings. Three windows overlook verdant gardens; nearby, you can take advantage of Hepburn's mirrored vanity. The master bathroom is renovated to include a glass-walled shower as well as a claw-foot soaking tub and twin sinks. The front room could be a bedroom or library with an archway to a comfortable study.

Fourth Floor:
The front bedroom includes three tall windows, hardwood floors, and a renovated en suite bath with a glass shower and dressing room. The rear bedroom also includes an adjoining full bath with tub as well as a decorative fireplace.

Cellar Level:
This unfinished level houses the laundry room, as well as extensive storage space and building mechanicals.",Midtown East,Manhattan,,,

With todays social and technological paradigms in mind, 10 Montieth invites residents into a ground-breaking world of accessibility and connectivity, one that celebrates user experience and champions shared perspective. Encapsulating one full block in Brooklyns coveted Bushwick neighborhood, 10 Montieths distinct modular form holds studio, one, and two-bedroom apartments at affordable and market rates, each pixelating the buildings faade with cascading terraces. Here, living space extends beyond each apartments four walls with ample outdoor space: the sloping rooftop garden is primed for group activities or moments of solitude while the inner courtyards serve as unexpected urban retreats.

Where most residential buildings play it safe, 10 Montieth breaks the mold. The O-shaped height is lowered in key areas to increase sunlight exposure for the courtyard and interior facades while tethering the building to the community with a scaled down vertical footprint. Similarly, the sloped roof creates unique points of access from the top levels of the building and the structures shape allows for views of Manhattan from street-facing and inner courtyard apartments. A living, breathing canvas of expression for its residents and community, 10 Montieth is the ideal address for New Yorks next wave of visionaries.",Bushwick,Brooklyn,107,1.0,07

You'll find that we're very relaxed about most things. 

We are pet friendly.

The space has great potential. 

The balcony is perfect for sipping a morning coffee. Or put a table and 4 chairs for a lazy Saturday morning brunch. Put a cozy chair out there and curl up with a blanket and a book on a fall day or gather a few friends and a large pitcher of iced tea on a hot summer day.

Large backyard with grill (Feel free to put furniture out there or a bonfire pit. We don't mind you throwing summer gill parties out there. Just pick up after yourselves by some point the next day since this is a shared space with another apartment.)

The backyard also has fruits and vegetables planted (cherries, peaches, asian pears, tomato, and onion). Feel free to pick at these or even plant some of your own (we used to grow mint for tea).

New custom doors, premium door handles, upgraded led lighting,  quartz countertops, original hardwood flooring,  stainless steel appliances, and an amazing closet system in the master bedroom. Apartment is pre-wired for cable, internet, and has a video intercom system. I'm boasting, but you have to see the apartment in person to truly appreciate the flow and the level of thought the owner has put in to make a tenant feel at home.

This is a NO FEE apartment! Tenant pays first month rent and $2600 security deposit. Must make 40x rent roll, have verifiable rental history, and respectable credit score. Heat and hot water included in monthly rent, and tenant responsible for their electric, gas charges, and cable bill. Sorry, no pets.

With todays social and technological paradigms in mind, 10 Montieth invites residents into a ground-breaking world of accessibility and connectivity, one that celebrates user experience and champions shared perspective. Encapsulating one full block in Brooklyns coveted Bushwick neighborhood, 10 Montieths distinct modular form holds studio, one, and two-bedroom apartments at affordable and market rates, each pixelating the buildings faade with cascading terraces. Here, living space extends beyond each apartments four walls with ample outdoor space: the sloping rooftop garden is primed for group activities or moments of solitude while the inner courtyards serve as unexpected urban retreats.

Where most residential buildings play it safe, 10 Montieth breaks the mold. The O-shaped height is lowered in key areas to increase sunlight exposure for the courtyard and interior facades while tethering the building to the community with a scaled down vertical footprint. Similarly, the sloped roof creates unique points of access from the top levels of the building and the structures shape allows for views of Manhattan from street-facing and inner courtyard apartments.

2BR apt in Bedford Stuyvesant, with a lovely big backyard (hammock, patio furniture, and grill included).

Perfect for a couple who wants to have an office/guest bedroom. There is a living and dining room, a granite and stainless steel kitchen with recessed lighting, and 1.5 bathrooms. It comes with a storage room, washer/dryer in basement, and is pet friendly.

The apartment has ductless AC (the kind they often have in hotel rooms), which works much better, looks better, and is more energy-efficient than in-wall AC.

There's no broker's fee-- we are the owners and would like to choose our tenants ourselves. There's an application/credit check fee our property management company runs which I believe is $250. Combined income needs to be at least $100,000/year.

This sunny and stunning single-family home will dazzle you with its openness and luxury. Tall windows flood every floor with sunlight, and a double-height ceiling on the garden floor makes a striking impression. With four different outdoor spaces and a coveted location, this is a home that will bring you endless delight.

Baxt/Ingui, premier residential architects, have completed a breathtaking brand-new renovation, giving this house not only new splendor, but state-of-the-art systems. This is a passive house, which means it has been completely sealed against drafts. As a result, you have an ultra-efficient, ecologically sound home which takes less energy and money to keep warm, while keeping out noise and pests. A sophisticated ventilation system tempers the fresh air that constantly flows into the house. Triple-glazed windows are passive house certified and landmark approved, preserving both warmth and elegance.

Garden Level:
An entertaining or family room greets you as you enter from beneath the stoop. In the rear, youll find a kitchen with a grand double-height ceiling, floor-to-ceiling windows with garden views, a wine refrigerator, top-of-the-line appliances (Subzero, Wolf, and Gaggenau), seating at a large Caesar Stone center island, and plentiful storage. This floor also enjoys a powder room, and a walk-in closet that could be used as a pantry. The kitchen leads to the garden, your own oasis and connection to the earth.

Parlour Level:
Enter a grand living room with eleven-foot ceilings from a newly restored, historically accurate stoop, and take note of the Eco Hearth ethanol-burning fireplace. In the rear, youll find a light-filled dining room with its own back staircase down to the kitchen. The floor-to-ceiling windows that cover the back wall afford generous sunlight and beautiful garden views.

Third Floor:
This entire floor is devoted to the master suite. An enormous Bianco Carrara and Thassos marble master bath with a soaking tub occupies the front of this level, separated from the bedroom by two adjoining walk-in closets. The grand master bedroom features brand new white oak floors, a wet bar, and a secluded reading nook in the back, with copious sunlight flowing in through the glass that covers the back wall. French doors lead to your own private balcony overlooking the garden.

Fourth Floor:
Two bedrooms occupy this level, which could also be purposed as offices, studios, or dens. The front room has a wet bar, while the rear room leads out to a gorgeous private roof deck. Each room has its own closet and white oak floors. The two rooms share a Statuary marble full bath.

Fifth Floor:
This floor provides two more generous, full-sized bedrooms, each with white oak floors and their own full bath and closet. If you have children, there will be no arguing over who has a larger or better bedroom!

Roof:
This glassed-in roof deck will make an exquisite space for entertaining or just getting away from it all. Enjoy a glass of wine as you take in the neighborhood from the top of your building. As a bonus, its even accessible via the elevator!

Cellar Level:
With its high ceilings, this finished basement could easily be a rec room or a gym. It hosts a laundry room, a powder room, and brand-new mechanicals and electrics. Between the four inches of insulation and vapor barrier beneath the floor, and the multiple sump pumps, you have remarkable control of the climate and humidity; warmth stays in and moisture stays out.",Upper West Side,Manhattan,,,

IF YOU MUST HAVE A VIEW OR DON'T LIKE THE 1ST FLOOR NO NEED TO READ ANY FURTHER. If you want a Huge RENT STABILIZED Alcove Studio that's the size of many 1BRs, consider this one. It's on the lobby level, above street level. I live in the bldg, in an alcove studio of the same Line, and many of my friends have said it's as big as a 1BR. You'll get light from 6 Windows, including large corner Casement Windows--the windows are part of what make this bldg well known and desired. This Studio also has 3 very big Closets, more closet space than in some 2BRs I have seen.

The Hardwood floors are gorgeous and intact. There is a full-sized Bath with classic Art-Deco yellow and black tiles, and a big, deep Cast-iron Tub.

Elevator bldg with Smart-Card Laundry Room. PETS OK. Full-time Live-in Super and Full-time Porter.
Quiet Marble Hill bldg.

Marble Hill, a beautiful enclave of apt. bldgs and private homes, is just 2 min. north of Inwood, over the Broadway Bridge and Harlem River. 5 Supermarkets within 10 min. of the bldg, Target & $10-a-month fitness facility right around the corner. 1-Train is less than 2 blocks away, 30 min. to Midtown, or fall down into the Metro North Hudson Line, 20 min. to Grand Central. Short bus ride or 12-min walk over the bridge to the A-Train or Inwood Greenmarket on Saturdays.

No view is the trade-off, but you can get a lot for your money with this Alcove Studio. I live in the same studio line. As the Resident Broker I can answer your questions about the neighborhood, and will work with your schedule, days, evenings or Saturdays. PHOTOS ARE OF THE ACTUAL APARTMENT.

Encapsulating one full block in Brooklyns coveted Bushwick neighborhood, 10 Montieths distinct modular form holds studio, one, and two-bedroom apartments at affordable and market rates, each pixelating the buildings faade with cascading terraces. Here, living space extends beyond each apartments four walls with ample outdoor space: the sloping rooftop garden is primed for group activities or moments of solitude while the inner courtyards serve as unexpected urban retreats.

Where most residential buildings play it safe, 10 Montieth breaks the mold. The O-shaped height is lowered in key areas to increase sunlight exposure for the courtyard and interior facades while tethering the building to the community with a scaled down vertical footprint. Similarly, the sloped roof creates unique points of access from the top levels of the building and the structures shape allows for views of Manhattan from street-facing and inner courtyard apartments. A living, breathing canvas of expression for its residents and community, 10 Montieth is the ideal address for New Yorks next wave of visionaries.

With todays social and technological paradigms in mind, 10 Montieth invites residents into a ground-breaking world of accessibility and connectivity, one that celebrates user experience and champions shared perspective. Encapsulating one full block in Brooklyns coveted Bushwick neighborhood, 10 Montieths distinct modular form holds studio, one, and two-bedroom apartments at affordable and market rates, each pixelating the buildings faade with cascading terraces. Here, living space extends beyond each apartments four walls with ample outdoor space: the sloping rooftop garden is primed for group activities or moments of solitude while the inner courtyards serve as unexpected urban retreats.

Where most residential buildings play it safe, 10 Montieth breaks the mold. The O-shaped height is lowered in key areas to increase sunlight exposure for the courtyard and interior facades while tethering the building to the community with a scaled down vertical footprint. Similarly, the sloped roof creates unique points of access from the top levels of the building and the structures shape allows for views of Manhattan from street-facing and inner courtyard apartments. A living, breathing canvas of expression for its residents and community, 10 Montieth is the ideal address for New Yorks next wave of visionaries.
